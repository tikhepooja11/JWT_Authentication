Postman APIs : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xgg4uCYBp9oXDEsuvJzK4VyA6GR9js1e/view?usp=sharing

DB design : https://dbdesigner.page.link/KBbFQYgfF1pb8ZnEA

How to use: 

- Import the Postman APIs json to your Postman Application
  - There are different folders to hit APIs.
  - Since there is User Authentication, most the APIs can be hit only with auth token. You can get the auth token by Registering user via Register User API and Loging in User via User Login API. (For the worst case we have Get All Users that can be hit without auth token )

- You can have a look of DB design from the link given above.
